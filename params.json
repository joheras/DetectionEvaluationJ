  "body": "DetectionEvaluationJ is an [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/) plugin that has been designed to evaluate the performance of object detection algorithms using several metrics. From a set of images, the gold standard associated with such images, and the detected regions obtained by the detection algorithm, DetectionEvaluationJ generates a report that summarises the performance of the detection algorithm based on the available measures.\r\n\r\nDetectionEvaluationJ is free to use and licensed under the license GNU GPL 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nYou can download DetectionEvaluationJ from [here](https://github.com/joheras/DetectionEvaluationJ/blob/master/dist/DetectionEvaluationJ_.jar). \r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n[ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/) or [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n1. Download and install either ImageJ or Fiji.\r\n2. Download the [DetectionEvaluationJ](https://github.com/joheras/DetectionEvaluationJ/blob/master/dist/DetectionEvaluationJ_.jar).\r\n3. Put the jar file downloaded in the previous step into your ImageJ/Fiji plugins folder.\r\n\r\nAfter restarting ImageJ/Fiji, you will find the option IJ-OpenCV under the plugins menu. That submenu contains the plugins developed with this library.\r\n\r\n### Usage example\r\n\r\n### Source files\r\nThe source code of DetectionEvaluationJ is also freely available at the following [github page](https://github.com/joheras/DetectionEvaluationJ).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nJónathan Heras [joheras@gmail.com](mailto:joheras@gmail.com).\r\n",
